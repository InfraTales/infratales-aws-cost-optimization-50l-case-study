# Savings Calculation Methodology

## Formula
`Savings = (Cost_Before - Cost_After) * 12 Months`

## Inputs
- **Cost_Before**: ₹12,93,000 / month (based on 3-month average from Cost Explorer)
- **Cost_After**: ₹2,03,000 / month (projected based on new architecture + Savings Plans)

## Calculation
1. **Monthly Savings**: ₹12,93,000 - ₹2,03,000 = ₹10,90,000
2. **Annual Savings**: ₹10,90,000 * 12 = ₹1,30,80,000

## ROI Analysis
- **Engineering Effort**: 2 Engineers * 1 Month = ₹4,00,000
- **Net First Year Savings**: ₹1,30,80,000 - ₹4,00,000 = **₹1.26 Crores**
